# Simple-Calculator---Python
I created a "simple" calculator using python.

## Steps taken:
* Bring in calculator functions (add,subtract,multiply and divide).
* Put calculator functions in a dictionary called **calc_dict**.
* Ask for first number input and convert it to a float.
* Create a loop to print all symbols(keys) from calc_dict.
* Ask for symbol input.
* Ask for second number input.
* Calculate the first operation.
* Print out the first answer.
* Create a while loop to allow for reoccuring operations.
